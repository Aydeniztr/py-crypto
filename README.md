```

is an app to see market summarys and crypto currencys in real time with colored output on terminal 

if you want to just check one thing you can type
(to run these commands on windows just type python instead of python3):

```
python3 currency.py <the_thing_you_want_to_check> 

exp:'Bitcoin,Monero,APPL,GOOGL'

```

if you want to check currecys for multiple things you need to edit stocks.txt and run this command

```
python3 currency.py list
```

that's it

## installation

for linux run setup.sh in your shell(bash,ash,etc.)

for windows run setup.cmd in your shell
